This directory contains a minimal implementation of
Que Sera Consensus (QSC) built on Threshold Logical Clocks (TLC)
in [Erlang](https://www.erlang.org)
for fail-stop, non-Byzantine environments.
This model implements the QSC, TLCB, and TLCR algorithms detailed in the 
[new QSC preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.02291)
in only 37 lines of code representing the actual algorithm.

For background information on QSC and TLC,
and other model implementations in several languages, please see the
[top level of this repository](https://github.com/dedis/tlc/).
