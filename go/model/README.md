This Go package provides a minimal implementation of
[Threshold Logical Clocks (TLC) and Que Sera Consensus (QSC)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.07010)
for fail-stop, non-Byzantine environments.
For details on this package see the code and its
[GoDoc documentation](https://godoc.org/github.com/dedis/tlc/go/model).
For other TLC and QSC reference implementations in other languages see the
[top level of this repository](https://github.com/dedis/tlc/).
For the general principles of TLC and QSC see
[this draft paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.07010).
