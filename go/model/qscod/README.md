This Go package provides a minimal implementation of
Que Sera Consensus (QSC) built on Threshold Logical Clocks (TLC)
for fail-stop, non-Byzantine environments.
For background information on QSC and TLC,
and other model implementations in several languages, please see the
[top level of this repository](https://github.com/dedis/tlc/).
For more details on this package see the code and its
[GoDoc documentation](https://godoc.org/github.com/dedis/tlc/go/model/qscod).
